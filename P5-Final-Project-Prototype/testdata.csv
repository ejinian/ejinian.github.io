Adam and Eve,4004,Torah; Bible,"Adam is the first man created by God Himself. (Genesis 1:26 KJV) And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness…” The Lord molded a man from the dust and gave him the breath of life, thus he became a living body with a soul (Genesis 2:7 KJV ). God then placed “man” in the Garden of Eden wherein he was commissioned to name and post authority to all living creatures. As for the Biblical timeline, this marks the beginning of mankind at 4004according to Bishop Ussher’s chronology found in the King James Bible. Eve was created using one of Adam’s ribs by god and they were giving life in the garden of eden, their one rule was to not eat the apples. The 3rd chapter of Genesis tells us the story of how the serpent tempted Eve to eat the fruit from the forbidden tree. Eve found the fruit good and shared this with Adam. This action was the first disobedience recorded in the Bible. (Genesis 3:1-24 KJV) After disobeying God, Adam and Eve were cast out from the garden of Eden. Adam and Eve bear children – Cain, Abel, and Seth. (Genesis 4:1-26)"
Cain and Abel,3874,Torah; Bible,"Time came when Cain and Abel presented their offerings before the Lord. Cain offered fruits from the ground, while Abel offered selected fat firstlings from his sheep. The Lord God respected Abel’s offering but did not accept Cain’s. This made Cain’s countenance fall and his jealousy grew as time passed. One day, Cain invited Abel over to his field and slew him there thinking that his crime would be concealed (Genesis 4:3-8 KJV). Due to his actions, Cain was banished and fled to the land of Nod, east of Eden. Though he was cast out from the land where he shed his brother’s blood, God’s mercy was still with Cain. God gave Cain a mark for protection saying that who ever slays him, vengeance will be sevenfold (Genesis 4:9-16 KJV)."
Seth,3875,Torah; Bible,"He was born when Adam was a hundred and thirty years old. It is said that Seth was born to replace Abel, who Cain slew (Genesis 4:25 KJV). In Hebrew, Seth is equated to “set” or appointed. Since Cain killed Abel, God gave Adam a third son whose descendants would bring the Lord’s name (Genesis 4:26 KJV)."
Enoch,3769,Torah; Bible,"Enos or Enosh (1 Chronicles 1:1 KJV), which means “mortal man” in Hebrew, is the eldest son of Seth, and Adam and Eve’s grandson. He was born when Seth was one hundred and five years old (Genesis 5:6 KJV). It was mentioned in Genesis 4:26 KJV, that Seth had a son and named him Enos, then began men to call upon the name of the Lord."
Cainan,3679,Torah; Bible,"Cainan or Kenan (1Chronicle 1:2 KJV) is the eldest son of Enos. He was born when Enos was ninety years old (Genesis 5:9 KJV). Cainan came from the Hebrew word Kainan which means “their smith”."
Mahalaleel,3609,Torah; Bible,"Mahalaleel was born when Cainan was seventy years old (Genesis 5:12 KJV). It is believed that the name Mahalaleel means “praise of God”. Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, is the fourth generation from Adam in the line of Seth‘s descendants."
Jared,3544,Torah; Bible,"Jared, is the first son born of Mahalaleel at the age of sixty five (Genesis 5:15 KJV). The name Jared came from Hebrew origin which means “descent” or “descendant”."
Enoch,3382,Torah; Bible,"The name Enoch or Henoch (1 Chronicles 1:3 KJV) came from Hebrew origin that means “dedicated”. Enoch was the first son of Jared. He was born when Jared reached one hundred and sixty-two years old (Genesis 5:18). It was also mentioned in Genesis 5:22 that Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah. Three hundred years later the Bible says that Enoch skipped death. His body was never to be found after three hundred and sixty years of existence because God was pleased with his life (Hebrews 11:5 KJV). Further, the book of Jude also mentions that Enoch prophesied the coming of the Lord with His ten thousand saints (Jude 1:14 KJV)."
Methuselah,3317,Torah; Bible,"Methuselah is the eldest son of Enoch recorded in the Bible (Genesis 5:21 KJV) At the age of one hundred eighty-seven, Methuselah begat Lamech (Genesis 5:25 KJV). He lived for another seven hundred eighty-two years after he begat Lamech and had other sons and daughters (Genesis 5:26 KJV)."
Lamech,3130,Torah; Bible,"Lamech is the first son of Methuselah. Lamech means poor or bringing low. He was born when Methuselah was one hundred and eighty-seven years of age (Genesis 5:26 KJV). Lamech is the eighth generation descendant of Seth from Adam. If we look closely at our Bible Timeline chart, Adam should still be alive until the fifty-eighth year of Lamech’s existence."
Noah,2948,Torah; Bible,"The name Noah or pronounced Noach comes from a Hebrew verb which means “rest”. Noah is a descendant of Seth. He was born to Lamech when Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two years old (Genesis 5:28 KJV). Adam lived until Lamech was fifty-eight or just one hundred sixty-four years before Noah was born. The Bible describes Noah as a “just man and perfect in his generations”, and says he had even walked with God (Genesis 6:9 KJV). At the age of five hundred, Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth Genesis 5:32 KJV). Genesis chapter 6 tells us that God wants to destroy all living flesh he created and regrets creating them. However, Noah found grace in the eyes of God. (Genesis 6:8 KJV). God then commissioned Noah to build an ark.. Noah built a huge ark exactly as God instructed him and brought with him his sons, wife, his sons’ wives. And a pair of each living creature (Genesis 6:14-22 KJV) and seven of those that are clean beasts, male and female (Genesis 7:2 KJV). After the flood had subsided, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. He got drunk and was uncovered inside his tent Genesis 9:20 KJV). Ham, the youngest of his sons, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers about this. Shem and Japheth took a garment and walked backwards to avoid seeing their father’s nakedness and approached their father to cover his nakedness (Genesis 9:23 KJV). Noah woke up from his wine and knew what had happened. He cursed Canaan, youngest son of Ham, saying “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shell he be unto his brethren” (Genesis 9:25 KJV). And unto Shem and Japheth, Noah said: “Blessed be the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant” (Genesis 9:26-27 KJV)."
Shem,2448,Torah; Bible,"Shem or Sem (Luke 3:36 KJV) is one of Noah‘s sons (Genesis 5:32 KJV). From the Hebrew origin, it is believed that the name Shem also means “name”. He is considered to be the eldest since he is always first Whenever the Bible mentions the names of sons the Sons of Noah. After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. Getting drunk, Noah was witnessed by Ham, the youngest son, naked inside his tent. Instead of aiding his father, Ham went to his brothers and told what he saw. Shem and Japheth took a garment and approached their father backwards to avoid seeing their father’s nakedness. Noah woke up from the wine and knew what happened. Noah said, “Blessed be the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant” (Genesis 9:26-27 KJV)."
Ham,2447,Torah; Bible,"Ham, brother of Shem and Japeth, was born when Noah was five hundred years old (Genesis 5:32 KJV). He is also one of those who survived the great flood since he was in the ark with his father. The Biblical Timeline charts Ham’s birth in 2450, when Noah, his father was five hundred years old. The Bible doesn’t say the total number of years of Ham’s existence. The name Ham in Hebrew origin means “warm” or “hot”. In Egypt, Ham means “black”. We have also considered the Egyptian meaning of Ham since Egypt is Mizraim in the Bible and Mizraimis Ham’s son. Ham is the father of Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan, whom Noah cursed after Ham did not aid his father when he was drunk and naked (Genesis 9:22 KJV). After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard and drank from its wine. Noah got drunk and was naked in his tent. Ham witnessed his father nakedness and told his brother about it. Shem and Japheth walked backwards to their father and covered him. Noah woke up from his drunkenness and knew about what happened. Noah cursed Ham’s youngest son for Ham did not do anything to aid his father."
Japheth,2446,Torah; Bible,"He was one of the eight people who boarded the ark and survived the great flood (Genesis 7:13 KJV). It is believed that the name Japheth means “wide spreading” or “enlargement.” This may also explain why Noah said that “God shall enlarge Japheth” (Genesis 9:27 KJV). Japheth is the father of Gome, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Mesech, and Tiras. The number of years Japheth lived is uncertain. However, according to the Timeline of the Bible, Japheth was born around 2450. During the event of Noah’s drunkenness, Japheth and his brother, Shem took a garment with them and covered their father’s nakedness (Genesis 9:23 KJV). When Noah was sober, he pronounced a blessing to both Japheth and Shem, and cursed Canaan, youngest son of Ham."
The Flood,2348,Torah; Bible,"Genesis 6:1-7 tells us why God decided to destroy all creation with the flood. The Bible reads “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Genesis 6:6 KJV). Man’s “wickedness” was not profoundly explained in the Bible. However, we can generalize that sin was rampant during those days. One of man’s wickedness described was the unholy union of sons of God and daughters of men. It is believed that the “sons of God” and the “daughters of men” are referring to the descendants of Seth and Cain respectively. We can also assume that man had forgotten to burn offerings unto the Lord since burnt offerings were done during the time of Adam and after the flood. Nevertheless, God repented creating man on the earth. However, Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord (Genesis 6:8 KJV). God warned Noah about the destruction coming and commanded Noah to build an ark giving specific details (Genesis 6:14-16 KJV): Noah made the ark just like God described it. God then commanded Noah to gather one pair of every kind of creature and keep them alive. Also, he was to gather seven pairs of clean beasts. Genesis 7 describes how the flood took place. It was in the six-hundredth years of Noah’s life when the flood finally came. Seven days prior, God commanded Noah to get inside the ark together with his wife, sons, sons’ wives, and all the creatures God commanded Noah to gather. On the seventeenth day of the second month of the six-hundredth year of Noah’s life (2348 on the Bible Timeline Chart), the rain poured and the windows of heaven were opened (Genesis 7:11 KJV). The rain continued pouring over the earth for forty days and forty nights. And this killed all creatures, not on the ark."
Duration of the Flood,2347,Torah; Bible,"The flood lasted for one hundred and fifty days (Genesis 7:24 KJV). On the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the six-hundredth year of Noah’s existence, the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. The waters continually subsided until the tenth month (Genesis 8:4-5 KJV). On the six hundredth and first year of Noah’s existence, on the first day of the first month, the covering of the ark was removed and Noah saw that the face of the ground was dry (Genesis 8:13 KJV). On the twenty-seventh day of the second month of that same year, God spoke to Noah and commanded him, his wife, his sons, his sons’ wives and all other creatures to be fruitful so that the earth would be filled again (Genesis 8:14-19 KJV). Noah then built an altar unto the Lord and took all the clean beasts and fowls and gave burnt offerings unto the Lord. God smelled the sweet savour and said in His heart that never again would he curse the earth for man’s sake. In Genesis 9:8-11 God said to Noah and his sons, “And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and every living creature that is with you… neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.” As a token of that covenant, a rainbow would be present after it rains to remind God of his everlasting covenant (Genesis 9:12-17 KJV)."
Arphaxad,2346,Torah; Bible,"Arphaxad is one of the sons of Shem and grandson of Noah (Genesis 10:22 KJV). He was born when Shem was a hundred years old or two years after the flood (Genesis 11:10 KJV). Given this case, we can assume that Shem was born 2 years after Noah reached five hundred years old which was 2446. Provided this information, Arphaxad’s birth on the Biblical Timeline is 2346. It is said that Arphaxad dwelt in Mesopotamia and is the forefather of Chaldeans."
Selah,2311,Torah; Bible,"Salah or Sala (Luke 3:35 KJV) is the only son of Arphaxad mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 11:13 KJV). Salah may mean send out, branch or javelin. He was born when Arphaxad was thirty five years old (Genesis 11:12 KJV). Salah begat Eber when he was thirty years old and begat other sons and daughters. He lived four hundred and three years after he begat Eber (Genesis 11:14-15 KJV)."
Elam and Asshur,2300,Torah; Bible,"Biblical Character. Second son of Shem, son of Noah (Genesis 10:22; 1 Chronicles 1:17). Assyria was named after him although the name Asshur is sometimes used to refer to the place where his descendants dwell (Numbers 24:22, 24; Ezekiel 27:23).  He is on the Timeline of the Bible after the Flood (after 2300). Elam is recorded in history at the time of Sagron of Akkad around 2300 where it is listed on the Bible Timeline. Not long after the Elamites pillaged Ur and founded an Elamite kingdom inside Shnunna."
Assyria,1700,Torah; Bible,"Biblical Name for Assyria.  Asshur, a city characterized by the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris (Genesis 2:14) was the primary capital of Assyria. About 1700, Bel-kap-kapu founded this city. Afterward, the capital was changed to Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river. King of the Assyrian Gods. Asshur was the father of Assyrians. He gave power and life to every priestly king. A winged circle or globe with the human figure of a warrior god armed with a bow in its center was used to symbolize him as “the great god, king of all gods.”  Also, Asshur was used as part of a compound name for various Assyrian kings. Elam (which means forever in Hebrew) is the one of the sons of Shem, who was the son of Noah. His siblings are Arphaxad, Asshur, Lud, and Aram."
